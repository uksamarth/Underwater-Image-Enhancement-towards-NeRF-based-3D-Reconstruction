# Underwater-Image-Enhancement-towards-NeRF-based-3D-Reconstruction
In this project, we present a method for the enhancement of images captured underwater also we have done the 3D representation of the provided scene.

The goal of underwater image enhancement is to address these challenges and improve the
quality of underwater images. By enhancing contrast, removing haze, restoring lost colors, and
improving overall visibility and acuity, the enhanced images can provide clearer and more accurate representations of the underwater environment. Overall, the motivation behind underwater
image enhancement is to overcome the inherent limitations of underwater imaging and improve
the quality and accuracy of visual data captured in underwater environments.

# Objectives
1. To perform enhancement on given underwater images.

   
2.To use the enhanced images towards 3D reconstruction through NeRF.


3.To propose an efficient and effective method for improving underwater photographs. The
difficulties encountered by underwater photographs, such as haze, color distortion, low contrast,
and loss of human acuity owing to light dispersion and absorption.

4. To improve underwater image visibility, color accuracy, and quality for scientific research and
computer vision applications.
5. To validate algorithm effectiveness through experiments and comparisons with existing techniques.

# Problem statement
To demonstrate a learning-based architecture for the enhancement of images captured underwater towards NeRF-based 3D reconstruction.

#  Application in Societal Context
Enhancement of images captured underwater is one of the requirements in present societal
conditions. If we can achieve a more clear vision of the underwater scenario through such
learning-based models, it will be a tribute to many elements/roles of society.
Enhancement of images captured underwater and their reconstruction can have novel societal
applications as follows:

1. Marine Conservation and Research.
   
2.Coral Reef Monitoring.

3.Underwater Surveillance for Protected Areas.

4. Naval Special Operations
a) Reconnaissance missions.
b)Underwater Infiltration.
c)Hydrographic Surveying.
d)Mine Countermeasures.
e)Counter-Terrorism Operations.
5.Scientific Exploration
