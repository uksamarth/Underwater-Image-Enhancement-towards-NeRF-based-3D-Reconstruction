![NeRF Architecture](GIF/nerf%20arch%20final.png)



## Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing underwater images and utilizing these enhanced images for NeRF-based 3D reconstruction. Underwater imaging presents challenges such as haze, color distortion, low contrast, and loss of visibility. By improving the quality of underwater images, we aim to achieve more accurate 3D reconstructions using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) technology.

## Objectives

1. Perform image enhancement on underwater images to address challenges such as haze, color distortion, and low contrast.
2. Utilize the enhanced images for 3D reconstruction using NeRF-based techniques.
3. Propose an efficient method for improving underwater image quality and visibility.
4. Validate the effectiveness of the algorithm through experiments and comparisons with existing techniques.

## Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a learning-based architecture for enhancing underwater images and leveraging these enhanced images for NeRF-based 3D reconstruction. This involves addressing issues such as haze, color distortion, and low visibility in underwater photographs.

## Application in Societal Context

Enhancement of underwater images and 3D reconstruction have significant societal applications:

- **Marine Conservation and Research:** Improved visualization of underwater environments aids in marine conservation efforts and scientific research.
- **Coral Reef Monitoring:** Clearer images contribute to better monitoring and understanding of coral reef ecosystems.
- **Underwater Surveillance for Protected Areas:** Enhanced images can be used for surveillance in protected underwater areas.
- **Naval Special Operations:** Supports reconnaissance missions, underwater infiltration, hydrographic surveying, mine countermeasures, and counter-terrorism operations.
- **Scientific Exploration:** Enhancing underwater images benefits scientific exploration by providing clearer data for analysis.
